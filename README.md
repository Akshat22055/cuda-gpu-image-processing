# GPU Image Processing with CUDA

## Overview
This project demonstrates GPU-accelerated image processing using custom CUDA kernels.
Hundreds of images are processed in a single execution using the GPU.

## Features
- CUDA kernel for 3-pixel linear blur
- Batch processing of 200+ images
- GPU memory management and synchronization
- CLI argument support

## Build
```bash
make
